# Deep Learning Experiments for Image Processing

This repository contains the implementations and results of a series of deep learning experiments conducted as part of the CS5567 Deep Learning Final Project at UMKC under Dr. Jesse Lowe. The project explores advanced image processing techniques through a variety of tasks including image classification, transfer learning, fine-tuning, and segmentation using pre-trained deep neural networks.

# Overview

## The project is structured into two main parts:

    Part A: Advanced Classification Techniques
        Experiment 1: Custom CNN for CIFAR-10 image classification.
        Experiment 2: Transfer learning with pre-trained VGG-19 and ResNet models on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets.
        Experiment 3: Fine-tuning on Tiny ImageNet to assess adaptation to complex tasks.
        Experiment 4: Evaluating model memory loss or functional gain post fine-tuning.

    Part B: Segmentation and Style Transfer
        Experiment 1: Object localization and detection using a YOLOv8 model on a custom dataset.
        Experiment 2: Image segmentation with the SegFormer model on provided datasets.
        Generative Models Contest: Style transfer applying neural style techniques to personal images.

## Methods and Technologies

    Frameworks and Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch for model building and training.
    Tools: Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab for implementing and documenting the experiments.
    Data: Utilized CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet, and custom datasets for various experiments.

## Results

Each experiment is thoroughly documented with both the process and outcomes. Models' performance metrics during training and testing phases are recorded. Visualizations such as plots are preferred for representing results to highlight the effectiveness of different techniques and model configurations.

## Conclusion

The experiments conducted provide a comprehensive view of the capabilities of modern deep learning techniques in handling diverse and complex image processing tasks. The project not only reinforces the theoretical knowledge acquired during the course but also enhances practical skills in applying advanced deep learning models to real-world problems.
